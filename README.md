This repository contains the projects that I have done during the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer.

## Project
- `Titanic Survival Exploration` Using a manual implementation of the decision tree, a set of data is split into smaller and smaller groups (called nodes), by one feature at a time. Each time a subset of the data is split, our predictions become more accurate if each of the resulting subgroups are more homogeneous (contain similar labels) than before.
