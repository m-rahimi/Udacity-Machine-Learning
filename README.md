# Udacity-Machine-Learning
This repository contains the projects that I have done during the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer.

## Project
- `Titanic Survival Exploration` Use a manual implementation of the decision tree, a set of data is split into smaller and smaller groups (called nodes), by one feature at a time. Each time a subset of the data is split, our predictions become more accurate if each of the resulting subgroups are more homogeneous (contain similar labels) than before.
- `boston_housing` Evaluate the performance of a predictive model and try to improve the performance of the model by using cross-validation training technique and grid search technique.
- `student_intervention` impliment K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes models for a classification problem and compare their performance to chose the best model. Use grid search to tune the parametres and optimze the models.
