In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "*K-Nearest Neighbors*   \n",
    "KNN is a method used for classification and regression. It is a non-parametric method since it makes no assumption about the relation between variables and result and the probability distribution of the variables. It is conceptually simple and can work with relatively little information to solve complex problems. However, computationally it is expensive; each prediction takes O(dn) where d is the dimension and n is the number of observation.  The number of observations should increase exponentially by increasing the number of features to fill the space. KNN predicts based on the local information, K nearest neighbors, and the events at long distance don’t have any contribution on the prediction. KNN is used in finance and medicine. Combination of KNN with other methods such as SVM makes powerful techniques for prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Logistic Regression*    \n",
    "Logistic regression is used for classification. It is a powerful statistical way of modeling binomial outcome (takes value 0 or 1). The variables can be continuous or discontinuous but I think it works better for continuous variables. The fundamental assumption is that there is a linear relationship between variables and outcome, and therefore it is not a good model for non-linear problems. Logistic regression has many application in industry especially in cases with binomial outcome. For example, it is used to predict whether a patient has a given disease. Logistic regression is a good candidate for this problem since the outcome is binomial\n",
    "\n",
    "*Support Vector Machines*  \n",
    "Support vector machines (SVM) is used for classification and regression. The SVM divides the data into two categories by defining a hyper plane which has a maximum margin. SVM can perform linear and non-linear classification using kernel trick. It can be used effectively for high dimensional problem even the number of dimension is greater than the number of sample. It cannot provide probability estimate directly. SVM has many applications such as image classification, text categorization, hand-written characterization, and biology. SVM is a good candidate for this problem since it can classify two groups by a linear or non-linear hyperplane.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Decision Tree*  \n",
    "Decision tree is used for classification and regression. It is a non-parametric method and it can handle non-linear problem. It divides the features space into subspaces with similar properties or outcome that are most important to make a decision. It is easy to understand and interpret, and requires little data preparation. It can handle both numerical and categorical data. However, the method is very sensitive to the data; small changes in the data can lead to different splits that undermines the interpretability of the model. Decision trees are not very reproducible on future data. Decision tree has many applications such as astronomy, finance, medicine, and physics. It is a good candidate for this problem since it can handle both numerical and categorical data, and requires little data. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Naive Bayes*  \n",
    "Naïve Bayes is a classification technique based on Bayes’ Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors. Naive Bayes model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. It also perform well in multi class prediction. When assumption of independence holds, a Naive Bayes classifier performs better compare to other models like logistic regression and it needs less training data. It perform with categorical and numerical variables. For numerical variable, normal distribution is assumed. It is not good for probability prediction. If categorical variable has a category (in test data set), which was not observed in training data set, then model will assign a 0 (zero) probability and will be unable to make a prediction. Another limitation of Naive Bayes is the assumption of independent predictors. Naive Bayes classifiers mostly used in text classification (due to better result in multi class problems and independence rule) have higher success rate as compared to other algorithms. As a result, it is widely used in Spam filtering (identify spam e-mail) and Sentiment Analysis (in social media analysis, to identify positive and negative customer sentiments). Naive Bayes is not a good candidate for this problem since the features are not independent. However, I would like to test its performance and compare with other methods.\n"

    "The performance of decision trees strongly depends on the training and test data, changing the training and test data significantly changes the F1 test score, indicating that the decision trees is sensitive to the input data and it doesn’t have good performance for small sample. There is no linear correlation between the variables and output since logistic regression and SVM with linear kernel have small F1 scores. KNN has the best performance but I don't thing it is a good method for small number of samples. SVM with rbf kernel has a good performance, and increasing the number of sample improves the performance of the method. In the end, I think SVM is the best model for this problem since it can handle high dimension problem with small number of sample. "

    "SVM is a learning algorithm, using existing data to build a model for prediction. In this example, the SVM takes data about previous students (age, gender, family, etc) and their final results, who passed the exam who didn’t. Then it tries to find a gap between students’ data to separate two groups, and defines a boundary in the gap. The gap should be as wide as possible to maximize the distance between two groups. Often, though, it's not easy to draw a decision boundary in low dimensions, so the SVM separates the passing and failing students by line or plane. Using this function created with students we already know passed or not, the SVM can look at new students' data and predict if they will pass or not.  \n",
